## Divergence Theorem

The divergence theorem (Gauss's theorem) relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the volume integral of its divergence:

$$
\iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV = \iint_{\partial V} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

where:

- is a volume enclosed by surface ,
    
- is the outward normal surface element,
    
- is a continuously differentiable vector field.
