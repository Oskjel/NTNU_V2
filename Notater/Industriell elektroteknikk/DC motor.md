![](Pasted%20image%2020250218142433.png)## **Why Are All Three Components Necessary?**

1. $V_{a}$(Voltage Source):** Provides the power to drive the motor.
2. $R_{a}$â€‹ (Resistance):** Models **realistic losses** in the winding.
3. $L_{a}$ (Inductance):** Models the effect of **current lag and transient response**.

**Relevant formulas**

$$
\omega =n\cdot \frac{\pi}{30}
$$


## Difference in Shunt Excited and Seperatly Excited DC machine
***
- How you control the magnetic field used for creating rotation in the motor

**Shunt excited:**
The potensiometer with resistance and inductor
