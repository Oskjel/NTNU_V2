# Residue at a Pole of Higher Order

When a function has a **pole of order \(n\)** at a point \(z_0\), the residue at that point is calculated differently from a simple pole. The general method involves using a higher derivative.

## General Formula for Residue at a Pole of Order \(n\)

For a function \( f(z) \) with a pole of order \(n\) at \(z = z_0\), the residue is given by:

$$
\text{Res}(f, z_0) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i}\frac{1}{(n-1)!} \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \left[ (z - z_0)^n f(z) \right]
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the order of the pole.
- $\frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}}$
- $z_{0}$ is the pole
